Got it — we’ll keep it **technical**, but **plain and digestible**.

Here’s **Step 1** rewritten that way:

## **Step 1 — What is Quantum Computing?**

**Definition:**
Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the rules of **quantum mechanics** — the science that explains how tiny particles like electrons and photons behave.

**How it’s different from normal computers:**

* **Classical computers** use **bits**, which can be either **0** or **1**.
* **Quantum computers** use **qubits**, which can be **0**, **1**, or a **superposition** (a mix of both at the same time).

**Key technical terms in simple words:**

* **Superposition:** A qubit can be in more than one state at once.
* **Entanglement:** Two qubits can be linked so that changing one instantly affects the other.
* **Interference:** Quantum computers can make certain outcomes more likely and others less likely, controlling probabilities.

**Why this matters:**
Because qubits can store and process multiple states at once, quantum computers can perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers — especially for problems involving **large-scale data, encryption, and molecular simulations**.

**Quick analogy:**
A classical computer tries one combination at a time.
A quantum computer can explore many combinations **at the same time**.
